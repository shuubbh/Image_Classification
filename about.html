        <p>This is an realtime AI based Yoga pose estimation model 
         which recognize and identify a yoga asana from a frame of a video.
         we created this as a college  project. AI first predicts keypoints
         or coordinates of different parts of the body and then it use another 
         classification model to classify the poses if someone is doing a pose
         and  detects that pose.We have used Mediapipe To Predict the Keypoints 
         and building a neural network  which uses these coordinates and classify 
         a yoga pose. 
      This project focuses on exploring the different approaches for yoga pose classification.
